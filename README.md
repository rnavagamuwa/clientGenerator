# clientGenerator
This is a jaggery based application which generates the client side java sdk( jar file) for a given API. User has to pass the JSON file as the input. Swagger codegen is used for the client generation part. Instead of creating a maven project(Swagger codegen generates a maven project) this creates a jar file.
